Following an open spirit, we build on top of what others have already done before us. Many people have worked on what openness means for hardware, discussed the minimum requirements for documentation, or how to make projects findable. This week you will take a look into open source hardware licenses, the open hardware certification program (OSHWA Standard), documentation standards (Open Hardware DIN SPEC 3105) and how to make your project easy to find (OpenKnowHow project). These are powerful instruments if we know how to use them; you will then reflect on how these can be useful for your project, and apply them to your work.

Following an open spirit, we build on top of what others have already done before us. Many people have worked on what openness means for hardware, discussed the minimum requirements for documentation, or how to make projects findable. 

This week you will take a look into open source hardware licenses, the open hardware certification program ([OSHWA Standard](https://certification.oshwa.org/)), documentation standards ([Open Hardware DIN SPEC 3105](https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/DIN_SPEC_3105)) and how to make your project easy to find ([OpenKnowHow project](https://openknowhow.org/)). These are powerful instruments if we know how to use them; you will then reflect on how these can be useful for your project, and apply them to your work.



### Goal of the week
Understand the different open licensing and certification options available and increase your project findability

<!--### Assignments (to be distributed among submodules)
**Licensing**
- Choose a license or several licenses depending on the types of content you are providing.
- If you are using parts of other projects with licenses check if you attribute them correctl
**Findability**
- Follow these instructions to create a .yml file to include your project in openknowhow.org (You can use this online form to create the .yml file)
**Documentation**
- Go through the standards and see which applies for your project
- Revisit your documentation and adjust it.
- Follow our checklist to update your documentation so it is one step closer to fulfill DIN SPEC 3105
