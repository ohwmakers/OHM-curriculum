- Introduction to version control systems

Very likely the most known use case of version control comes from the software industry, where many different people are working on the same project at the same time. This makes it almost impossible to simply share one set of files around where each person would make changes to the files and then pass them on to the next one.

To solve this limitation, version control systems were created, so that people could simultaneously work on the same project and not lose track of what has been changed, where, by whom and why. It makes managing a project much easier as contributors can share the changes they have made and original projects developers can decide to take those changes on the project or not (and if not, share back with the contributors why).
